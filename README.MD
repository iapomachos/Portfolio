Hello there,
this repo works as a portfolio for all the code or config files that I'm confident to publish.

Curretly you will find here:
+ Various Scripts
+ Code I wrote for my Technological Institute lessons/labs
+ Code I wrote for additional Courses (e.g. udemy)
+ Docker Images that I currently have deployed in my Homelab
