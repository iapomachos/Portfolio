Hello there,
this repo works as a portfolio for all the code or config files that I'm confident to publish.

Curretly you will find here:
+ Various Scripts
+ Code I wrote for my Technological Institute lessons\labs
+ Code I wrote for additional Courses (eg udemy)
+ Docker Images that I currently have deployed in my Homelab

___
Please note that I wrote code for our ERP system but I can't post any of that on a public repo :)
